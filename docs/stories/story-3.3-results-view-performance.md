# Story 3.3: Results View Performance

- **As a** user,
- **I want** the results view to remain fast and responsive, even with thousands of results,
- **so that** the tool is usable for large datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The results list is rendered using a performance optimization technique like virtual scrolling or pagination to prevent UI freezes.
2.  If pagination is used, the user can easily navigate between pages of results.
3.  Scrolling through a large number of results is smooth and does not lag.
4.  The application's memory usage remains reasonable even when displaying a subset of a very large result set.
