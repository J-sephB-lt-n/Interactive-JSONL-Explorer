# Story 3.2: Results Display

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to see the log entries that match my query,
- **so that** I can analyze the data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The "Results" panel is populated with the entries returned from the filtering engine.
2.  A clear count of the total number of matching entries is displayed (e.g., "Showing 42 of 10,000 entries").
3.  Each JSON entry is rendered in a clean, readable format with syntax highlighting.
4.  Nested objects and arrays within a result are collapsible and expandable.
5.  The source filename for each entry is displayed with the result.
6.  If no entries match the query, a "No results found" message is displayed.
