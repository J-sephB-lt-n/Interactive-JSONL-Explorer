# Story 1.2: Basic UI Shell & Layout

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to see the main application layout,
- **so that** I understand the different functional areas of the tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The application renders the three-pane layout: a left sidebar for "Files & Schema," a top area for the "Query Builder," and a main content area for "Results."
2.  The UI adheres to the "Operator Dark" theme (dark background, light text).
3.  Placeholders are present in each of the three panes indicating their purpose.
4.  The layout is responsive and correctly fills the viewport on standard desktop screen sizes.
