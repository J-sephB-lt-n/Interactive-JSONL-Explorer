# Story 2.2: Schema Display

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to see the discovered schema in the UI,
- **so that** I can easily understand what fields are available for filtering.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The "Files & Schema" sidebar is updated to display the list of unique keys discovered in Story 2.1.
2.  The schema is presented in a hierarchical, collapsible tree view to represent nesting.
3.  Users can expand and collapse parent keys to show/hide nested keys.
4.  The display is updated automatically if the user uploads new files with different keys.
