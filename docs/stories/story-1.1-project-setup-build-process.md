# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Build Process

- **As a** developer,
- **I want** a complete project structure with a configured build tool,
- **so that** I can efficiently develop the application and generate the final, single HTML file artifact.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A Git repository is initialized with a standard `.gitignore` file.
2.  A `package.json` file is created to manage development dependencies.
3.  A lightweight build tool (e.g., Vite) is configured to handle JS/CSS bundling.
4.  The build process correctly inlines all JavaScript and CSS into a single `index.html` file.
5.  A development server with hot-reloading is available via an `npm` script (e.g., `npm run dev`).
6.  A production build can be generated via an `npm` script (e.g., `npm run build`).

## Dev Agent Record

### Status
**Status:** `Done`

### Tasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Git and create `.gitignore`.
- [x] Task 2: Initialize npm project and create `package.json`.
- [x] Task 3: Install all development dependencies (Vite, Vitest, Playwright, Prettier, ESLint).
- [x] Task 4: Set up Vite configuration (`vite.config.js`) to inline JS/CSS.
- [x] Task 5: Create the basic project folder structure (`src`, `public`, `index.html`).
- [x] Task 6: Configure `package.json` with `dev` and `build` scripts.
- [x] Task 7: Set up ESLint and Prettier.
- [x] Task 8: Verify the build process and dev server functionality.

### File List

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-07-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The project setup is clean, well-organized, and follows standard conventions. No application code was reviewed as this story focused solely on infrastructure. The use of Vite, ESLint, and Prettier establishes a high-quality foundation for future development.

### Refactoring Performed

None. No code refactoring was necessary for this story.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] The initial configuration files (`vite.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`) adhere to project standards.
- Project Structure: [✓] The directory structure (`src`, `public`, `docs`) is compliant.
- Testing Strategy: [✓] N/A for this story, but the inclusion of Vitest provides a solid foundation.
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria have been successfully verified.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All setup and configuration tasks are complete.

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities were identified. The `.gitignore` file is correctly configured to exclude sensitive files like `node_modules`.

### Performance Considerations

Vite provides excellent performance for both the development server and the production build. The configuration is optimal for this stage of the project.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
