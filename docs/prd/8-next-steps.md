# 8. Next Steps

## 8.1 UX Expert Prompt

> Hello! I need a high-fidelity design and a component library for the "Interactive JSONL Explorer." Please use the attached PRD as the source of truth for all requirements and UI goals. The design must adhere to the "Operator Dark" theme, use a three-pane layout, and follow WCAG AA accessibility standards. The key user flows to design are the file upload (including drag-and-drop), the dynamic query builder, and the virtualized results view.

## 8.2 Architect Prompt

> Your task is to create a complete technical architecture and implementation plan for the "Interactive JSONL Explorer" based on the attached PRD. The architecture must strictly adhere to all technical assumptions, especially the requirement for a vanilla JavaScript, single-file HTML output with no runtime frameworks. Please provide a detailed breakdown of the components, data structures, and the proposed build process. Pay special attention to the client-side performance strategy for parsing and rendering large datasets.
