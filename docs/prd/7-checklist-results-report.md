# 7. Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

*   **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
*   **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
*   **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
*   **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns:** The PRD is very strong. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit definition for scope boundaries (what is explicitly *out* of scope for the MVP), but this is implied by the tightly focused feature set and can be clarified with the Architect.

## Category Analysis

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PASS | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | Minor: Lacks an explicit "Out of Scope" section. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PASS | None |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | None |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PASS | None |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data, Integration, and Operational requirements are not explicitly detailed but are simple and implied by the client-side architecture. This is acceptable for this project's scope. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PASS | The document is clear, well-structured, and uses consistent language. |

## Top Issues by Priority

*   **BLOCKERS:** None.
*   **HIGH:** None.
*   **MEDIUM:** It would improve clarity to add a small section explicitly listing features that are "Out of Scope" for the MVP (e.g., user accounts, saving queries, sharing results).
*   **LOW:** While not strictly necessary for this project, explicitly stating operational requirements like "deployment via static file copy" would add formal completeness.

## MVP Scope Assessment

The scope defined in the epics and stories is a perfect representation of a Minimum Viable Product. It is focused entirely on the core user journey of uploading, querying, and viewing data. There are no "nice-to-have" features included. The complexity is low, and the timeline for this scope seems realistic.

## Technical Readiness

The technical constraints are exceptionally clear, particularly the mandate for a vanilla JS, single-file architecture. This provides strong guidance for the Architect. There are no major technical risks identified, as the chosen technologies are well-understood. The primary area for architectural investigation will be selecting the optimal performance strategy for the results view (pagination vs. virtual scrolling).

## Recommendations & Decision

My recommendation is to add a brief "Out of Scope" section for clarity, but this is not a blocker. The PRD is comprehensive, the stories are well-defined, and the technical constraints are clear.

**Final Decision: READY FOR ARCHITECT**
