# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1 Overall UX Vision

The application's user experience should be minimalist, intuitive, and highly functional, reflecting a professional tool for developers. The vision is to create an interface that is "discoverable," where new users can quickly understand its capabilities without a manual. The dark theme will be sophisticated, using typography and spacing to ensure clarity and reduce eye strain during long sessions. The overall feel should be fast, responsive, and efficient.

## 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Layout:** A three-pane layout will form the core of the interface: a left sidebar for file management and schema discovery, a central top area for the query builder, and a main content area below for displaying results.
*   **File Upload:** A prominent drag-and-drop zone and a clear "Upload Files" button will be present in the initial state and accessible later.
*   **Query Building:** An interactive, dynamic query builder will allow users to add/remove filter conditions. Each condition will consist of a key selector (dropdown of discovered keys), an operator selector (e.g., `equals`, `contains`), and a value input field.
*   **Results Display:** Results will be displayed in a paginated or virtualized list to handle large numbers of entries. Each JSON object will be presented in a collapsible, syntax-highlighted tree view.

## 3.3 Core Screens and Views

As a single-page application, the experience is defined by states rather than screens:
*   **Empty State:** The initial view of the application, featuring a clear call-to-action to upload JSONL files.
*   **Active State:** The main workspace view, displayed after files are loaded. This state contains the schema explorer, query builder, and results panel.

## 3.4 Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes ensuring sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigability for all interactive elements, and appropriate ARIA attributes.

## 3.5 Branding

Branding will be minimal and professional. The aesthetic will be "Operator Dark"â€”a clean, dark-themed interface that prioritizes content and functionality. The focus will be on excellent typography, consistent iconography, and a limited, purposeful color palette. No logo or specific brand identity is required at this stage.

## 3.6 Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web application designed primarily for desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). While it should be functional on mobile browsers, the UI will be optimized for the screen real estate and input methods of a desktop environment.
