# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

*   Deliver a slick, aesthetic, and intuitive user interface.
*   Package the entire application as a single HTML file with minimal dependencies.
*   Support uploading multiple JSONL files via drag-and-drop or a file picker.
*   Provide a clear and easy way for users to discover all available keys from the uploaded files.
*   Enable powerful filtering of JSON entries using flexible AND/OR combinations across any field.
*   Display filtered JSON entries in a clean, well-formatted, and easily readable view.

## 1.2 Background Context

The "Interactive JSONL Explorer" is designed to address the challenges developers and product managers face when analyzing structured logs and traces stored in JSONL format. Often, exploring these files requires custom scripts or cumbersome command-line tools, which hinders rapid exploration and debugging. This project aims to provide a streamlined, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing in-browser tool that simplifies this process.

By allowing users to upload multiple JSONL files and offering a powerful, intuitive interface for filtering and viewing the data, the explorer will significantly speed up the process of debugging application logs and gaining insights from application behavior. The primary users are developers needing to quickly diagnose issues and product managers seeking to understand application usage patterns through log data.
