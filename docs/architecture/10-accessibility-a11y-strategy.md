# 10. Accessibility (A11y) Strategy

The application will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards, as required by the PRD. Accessibility is a primary consideration and will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Semantic HTML:** Components will be constructed using semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, etc.) to ensure a meaningful and navigable structure for assistive technologies. Non-semantic elements (`div`, `span`) will be reserved for styling purposes.

*   **ARIA Roles & Attributes:** Where the semantics of dynamic components cannot be fully conveyed by native HTML, appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes will be used. This includes `role="status"` for announcing updates, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content, and attributes like `aria-label` for clarifying control purposes.

*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements—including file upload controls, query builder inputs, buttons, and result entries—will be fully operable via the keyboard. A logical and predictable focus order will be maintained throughout the application.

*   **Focus Management:** Clear and visible focus indicators will be present on all focusable elements. For UI components that appear and disappear, such as modals or dropdowns, focus will be managed programmatically to ensure a seamless experience for keyboard users.

*   **Color Contrast:** The "Operator Dark" theme will be implemented with color combinations that meet or exceed the WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text and UI components.

*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Automated:** An accessibility testing library (e.g., `axe-core`) will be integrated into the Playwright E2E test suite to automatically catch common violations during testing.
    *   **Manual:** Regular manual testing will be performed using keyboard-only navigation and screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure a high-quality, usable experience for all users.
