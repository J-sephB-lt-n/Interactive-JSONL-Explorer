# Epic 1: Foundation & Core File Handling

## Goal

The goal of this epic is to establish the complete foundational structure of the application. This includes setting up the development environment, the build process to generate the single HTML file, and implementing the core UI layout. It will also deliver the essential functionality of allowing a user to upload JSONL files via both a file picker and drag-and-drop, and have those files parsed and stored in memory, ready for the next epic.
