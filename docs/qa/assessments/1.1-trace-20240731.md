# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.1 - Project Setup & Build Process

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 6
- Fully Covered: 6 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: A Git repository is initialized with a standard `.gitignore` file.

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Check for the existence of the `.gitignore` file.
  - Given: The project directory.
  - When: Listing files in the root.
  - Then: The `.gitignore` file is present.

#### AC2: A `package.json` file is created to manage development dependencies.

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Inspect `package.json`.
  - Given: The project directory.
  - When: Reading the `package.json` file.
  - Then: The file exists and contains a `devDependencies` section.

#### AC3: A lightweight build tool (e.g., Vite) is configured to handle JS/CSS bundling.

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Inspect `vite.config.js`.
  - Given: The project directory.
  - When: Reading the `vite.config.js` file.
  - Then: The file exists and is configured for the project.

#### AC4: The build process correctly inlines all JavaScript and CSS into a single `index.html` file.

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Inspect `vite.config.js` for `vite-plugin-singlefile`.
  - Given: The Vite configuration.
  - When: Examining the plugins array in `vite.config.js`.
  - Then: `viteSingleFile()` plugin is included, which ensures all assets are inlined.

#### AC5: A development server with hot-reloading is available via an `npm` script (e.g., `npm run dev`).

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Inspect `scripts` in `package.json`.
  - Given: The `package.json` file.
  - When: Checking the `scripts` section.
  - Then: A `dev` script exists and is configured to run Vite (`"dev": "vite"`).

#### AC6: A production build can be generated via an `npm` script (e.g., `npm run build`).

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Verification**: Inspect `scripts` in `package.json`.
  - Given: The `package.json` file.
  - When: Checking the `scripts` section.
  - Then: A `build` script exists and is configured to run Vite build (`"build": "vite build"`).

### Critical Gaps

None identified. All acceptance criteria are fully covered by the project's setup and configuration.

### Test Design Recommendations

For this story, manual verification of the build process and development server is sufficient. No automated tests are recommended for the project setup itself. Future stories with application logic will require unit and integration tests.

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: 0
- **Medium Risk**: 0
- **Low Risk**: All requirements are low risk as they are related to project setup and are fully verifiable.
